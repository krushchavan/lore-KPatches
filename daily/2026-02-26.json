In my experience with other bugs, the interplay between the\nclustered algorithm and the unclustered algorithm is under-specified so\nI think it is likely you have indeed found a bug. \n\nIf you want to fix it, I would proceed along the lines I complained\nabout in my first response and try to define the relationships between\nthe variables in a consistent way that explains why we shouldn't count\nthat variable here.\n\nIf you do go through with sharpening the definition of empty_cluster,\nI would be happy to review that work and help get it in.\n\nThanks,\nBoris\n\n> > \n> > I tested this on stable kernel 6.6.\n> > \n> > Signed-off-by: Alex Lyakas <alex.lyakas@zadara.com>\n> > ---\n> >  fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c | 2 +-\n> >  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)\n> > \n> > diff --git a/fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c b/fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c\n> > index 03cf9f242c70..84b340a67882 100644\n> > --- a/fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c\n> > +++ b/fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c\n> > @@ -3885,7 +3885,7 @@ static int find_free_extent_unclustered(struct btrfs_block_group *bg,\n> >  \t\tfree_space_ctl = bg->free_space_ctl;\n> >  \t\tspin_lock(&free_space_ctl->tree_lock);\n> >  \t\tif (free_space_ctl->free_space <\n> > -\t\t    ffe_ctl->num_bytes + ffe_ctl->empty_cluster +\n> > +\t\t    ffe_ctl->num_bytes +\n> >  \t\t    ffe_ctl->empty_size) {\n> >  \t\t\tffe_ctl->total_free_space = max_t(u64,\n> >  \t\t\t\t\tffe_ctl->total_free_space,\n> > -- \n> > 2.43.0\n> > \n\n",
