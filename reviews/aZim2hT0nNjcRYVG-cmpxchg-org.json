When there is no swap, MGLRU still performs\nworse in some workloads like MongoDB. From what I've noticed that's\nbecause the PID protection is a bit too passive, and there is a force\nprotection in sort_folio which sometimes seems too aggressive.\nActive/Inactive LRU will just move a folio to head if it's accessed\ntwice while in RAM, but MGLRU won't do so, as result hotter file\nfolios are evicted equally as the colder one until the PID gets\ntriggered, or still gets protected even if it hasn't been used for a\nwhile. And by the time PID finally gets triggered, the workload might\nhas changed. This is fixable using the approach I mentioned though,\nand it seems to be better than the Active/Inactive in all our known\ncases after that, whether that is a good fix worth discussion.\n\nI also notice Ridong has a series to apply a \"heat\" based reclaim,\nwhich also looks interesting.\n\n> >    Can we just ignore the shadow for anon folios?

For MGLRU currently it already ignored\nthe shadow distance for re-activation. And yeah, basically all anons\nare activated on fault, which turns out to be quite nice? None MGLRU\nusers considered that as a problem and in fact the performance looks\ngood.\n\nOf course we can restore the old behavior to test the folio\nagainst some distance (gen distance or eviction distance), or push it\nfurther to only keep the reference bit (not completely ignore the\nshadow, just only keep the reference bits, if the LFU + PID still\nworks well without the distance), and gain more performance and bits\nto use.\n\nBTW I tried to restore the refault distance behavior for both anon and\nfile folios sometime ago:\nhttps://lwn.net/Articles/945266/\n\nFor file folios it indeed looked better, anon folios seems unchanged.\nBut later tests showed that it doesn't apply to all cases, and I think\nsomething better can be used as suggested in this topic.\n\n\n",
