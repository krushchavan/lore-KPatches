For auto-regions, you might have another\nendpoint show up looking for the partially created region - and then\njust go off and create it anyway because it thinks it was first.\n\nBut in my driver, i'm explicitly converting these auto-regions into\nother things, and if that fails it causes *all other* region creation to\nfail - even if it wasn't actually dependent on that original region.\n\nThis is only an issue if you have two devices unbind/bind cycling at\nthe same time - i.e.\n\n   echo 0000:d0:00.00 > cxl_pci/unbind\n   echo 0000:e0:00.00 > cxl_pci/unbind\n   echo 0000:d0:00.00 > mydriver/bind\n   echo 0000:e0:00.00 > mydriver/bind\n\nIf the platform has pre-programmed and locked the decoders, and one of\nthe two devices fails to probe and leaves a hanging partially\ncreated region, the other device will fail too.\n\nIt's a pretty narrow failure scenario.\n\n~Gregory",
