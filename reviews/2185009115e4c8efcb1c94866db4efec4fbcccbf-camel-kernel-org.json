The author acknowledges that reordering the tracepoint fields for better packing has material consequences and will look at it.\n\nAuthor acknowledged the need to reorder tracepoint fields for better packing, which has material consequences, and agreed to address this in a future patch.",

That's part of the ABI and has to remain unsigned\nlong. The point of this series is to make inode->i_ino a u64. Any event\nholding an ino_t today is going to need a 64-bit field to fully\ndescribe it.\n\nAnd to be clear, this should make things better for 32-bit boxes in the\nlong run. Once this change is done, i_ino should be a reliable source\nof info regardless of machine's word size.\n\nFor the tracepoints, I think it's best to just extend them to 64-bit\nfields outright rather than using the new (temporary) kino_t typedef\nthat I'm adding.\n\n---\n\nThanks for the review! I'll definitely look at reordering the\ntracepoint fields for better packing since that has material\nconsequences.\n-- \nJeff Layton <jlayton@kernel.org>\n\n______________________________________________________\nLinux MTD discussion mailing list\nhttp://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/linux-mtd/",

      "patch_summary": "This patch updates VFS-layer trace events to use 64-bit fields for inode numbers (i_ino) instead of the current unsigned long type. This change is necessary because the i_ino field will be converted to a u64 in future patches, and existing tracepoints need to accommodate this change. The update aims to improve reliability and consistency across different machine architectures, including 32-bit systems."
