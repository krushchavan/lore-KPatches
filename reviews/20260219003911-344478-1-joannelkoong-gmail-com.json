          "raw_body": "<willy and I had a chat; this is a clumsy non-AI summary of it>\n\nI started looking at folio read state management in iomap, and made a\nfew observations that (I hope) match what willy's grumpy about.\n\nThere are three ways that iomap can be reading into the pagecache:\na) async ->readahead,\nb) synchronous ->read_folio (page faults), and\nc) synchronous ->read_folio_range (pagecache write).\n\n(Note that (b) can call a different ->read_folio_range than (c), though\nall implementations seem to have the same function)\n\nAll three of these IO paths share the behavior that they try to fill out\nthe folio's contents and set the corresponding folio/ifs uptodate bits\nif that succeeds.  Folio contents can come from anywhere, whether it's:\n\ni) zeroing memory,\nii) copying from an inlinedata buffer, or\niii) asynchronously fetching the contents from somewhere\n\nIn the case of (c) above, if the read fails then we fail the write, and\nif the read succeeds then we start copying to the pagecache.\n\nHowever, (a) and (b) have this additional read_bytes_pending field in\nthe ifs that implements some extra tracking.  AFAICT the purpose of this\nfield is to ensure that we don't call folio_end_read prematurely if\nthere's an async read in progress.  This can happen if iomap_iter\nreturns a negative errno on a partially processed folio, I think?\n\nread_bytes_pending is initialized to the folio_size() at the start of a\nread and subtracted from when parts of the folio are supplied, whether\nthat's synchronous zeroing or asynchronous read ioend completion.  When\nthe field reaches zero, we can then call folio_end_read().\n\nBut then there are twists, like the fact that we only call\niomap_read_init() to set read_bytes_pending if we decide to do an\nasynchronous read.  Or that iomap_read_end and iomap_finish_folio_read\nhave awfully similar code.  I think in the case of (i) and (ii) we also\ndon't touch read_pending_bytes at all, and merely set the uptodate bits?\n\nThis is confusing to me.  It would be more straightforward (I think) if\nwe just did it for all cases instead of adding more conditionals.  IOWs,\nhow hard would it be to consolidate the read code so that there's one\nfunction that iomap calls when it has filled out part of a folio.  Is\nthat possible, even though we shouldn't be calling folio_end_read during\na pagecache write?\n\nAt the end of the day, however, there's a bug in Linus' tree and we need\nto fix it, so Joanne's patch is a sufficient bandaid until we can go\nclean this up.\n\n--D",

Calling folio_end_read() on a folio that was\nalready marked uptodate clears the uptodate bit.\n\nFix this by not marking the folio as uptodate if the read IO has bytes\npending.
