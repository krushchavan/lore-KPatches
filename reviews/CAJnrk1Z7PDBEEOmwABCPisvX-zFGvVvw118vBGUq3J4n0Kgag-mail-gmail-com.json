He requested a sanity check in fuse_copy_do() or fuse_copy_fill(), pointed out an unused flag that could be used instead of adding new code, and noted a missing 'if bl' condition. Additionally, he asked for documentation on the 'buf_group' parameter and suggested including the actual liburing call in the documentation.",
