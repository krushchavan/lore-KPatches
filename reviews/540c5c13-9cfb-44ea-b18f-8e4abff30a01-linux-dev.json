It might also be\n     fair to say that order > current  buddy order might behave different\n     at least to some degree (thinking about relation to zone alignment,\n     section sizes etc).\n\n     If we require vmemmap for these larger orders, maybe the buddy order\n     could more easily exceed the section size; I don't remember all of\n     the details why that limitation was in place (but one of them was\n     memmap continuity within a high-order buddy page, which is only\n     guaranteed within a memory section with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM).\n\n(b) Teaching compaction etc. to *also* compact/group on a larger\n     granularity (in addition to current sized pageblocks). When we\n     discussed that in the past we used the term superblock, that\n     Zi Yan just brought up again in another thread [1].\n\n\n\nThere was a proposal a while ago to internally separate zones into \nchunks of memory (I think the proposal used DRAM banks, such that you \ncould more easily power down unused DRAM banks). I'm not saying we \nshould do that, but maybe something like sub-zones could be something to \nexplore.
