One possible solution would be\nto remember the last node and accumulate until it differs, then flush:\n\nfallback_loop() {\n\tpage = alloc_pages();\n\tnid = page_to_nid(page);\n\tif (nid != last_nid) {\n\t\tif (node_count) {\n\t\t\tmod_node_page_state(...);\n\t\t\tnode_count = 0;\n\t\t}\n\t\tlast_nid = nid;\n\t}\n}\n\nif (node_count)\n\tmod_node_page_state(...);\n\nBut it IS the slow path, and these are fairly cheap per-cpu\ncounters.
