It was accidently allowed\nand completely broken before that.\n\nFor O_DIRECTORY without O_CREAT the kernel will pass that down through\n->atomic_open:: to the filesystem.\n\nThe worry that I see is that a network filesystem via ->atomic_open::\nsomehow already called open on the server side on something that wasn't\na directory. At that point the damage such as side-effects from device\nopening is already done.\n                                    \nBut I suspect that every filesystem implementing ->atomic_open:: just\ndoes finish_no_open() and punts to the VFS for the actual open. And the\nVFS will catch it in do_open() for it actually opens the file. So the\nonly real worry for O_DIRECTORY I see is that there's an fs that handles\nit wrong.\n\nFor (2) it is problematic as there surely are filesystems with\n->atomic_open:: that do handle the ~O_CREAT case and return with\nFMODE_OPENED. So that'll be problematic if the intention is to not\ntrigger an actual open on a non-regular file such as a\ndevice/socket/fifo etc. before the VFS had a chance to validate what's\ngoing on.\n\nSo I'm not excited about having this 70% working and punting on\n->atomic_open:: waiting for someone to fix this. One option would be to\nbypass ->atomic_open:: for OPENAT2_REGULAR without O_CREAT and fallback\nto racy and pricy lookup + open for now. How problematic would that be?\nIf possible I'd prefer this a lot over merging something that works\nhalf-way.\n\nI guess to make that really work you'd need some protocol extension?",
