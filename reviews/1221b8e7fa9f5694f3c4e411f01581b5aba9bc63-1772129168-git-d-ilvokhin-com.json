The implementation uses a lightweight inline helper that checks whether tracing is enabled, and calls an out-of-line helper when tracing is active. When CONFIG_TRACING is disabled, the helpers compile to empty inline stubs, leaving the fast path unaffected. This allows for easier debugging and analysis of zone lock behavior."
