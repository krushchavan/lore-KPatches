      "patch_summary": "This patch series introduces per-memcg-lruvec zswap accounting by adding a new array of objcg pointers to the zpdesc structure, allowing for accurate tracking of memory usage by zswap and reducing NR_ZSWAP. The changes also move memcg charges to the zsmalloc layer, which is the only user of zswap at this time."
