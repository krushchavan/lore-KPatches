When we\n     discussed that in the past we used the term superblock, that\n     Zi Yan just brought up again in another thread [1].\n\n\n\nThere was a proposal a while ago to internally separate zones into \nchunks of memory (I think the proposal used DRAM banks, such that you \ncould more easily power down unused DRAM banks).
