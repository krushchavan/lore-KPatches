Even in well controlled environments you would run in a hyperscaler?

I think what Kirill is trying to say is that &quot;it breaks userspace&quot;. ;)

A hyperscaler (or other &quot;embedded&quot; environment) might be willing or able
to go fix up userspace breakage. I would suspect our high frequency
trading friends would be all over this if it shaved a microsecond off
their receive times.

The more important question is what it breaks and how badly it breaks
things. 5-level paging, for instance, broke some JITs that historically
used the new (&gt;48) upper virtual address bits for metadata. The gains
from 5-level paging were big enough and the userspace breakage was
confined and fixable enough that 5-level paging was viable.

I&#x27;m not sure which side a larger base page side will fall on, though. Is
it going to be an out-of-tree hack that a few folks use, or will it be
more like 5-level paging and be good enough that it goes into mainline?

&gt; 
&gt; Yes. Probably similar to Intel proposing an actual 64k page size. Expected.
&gt; :)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; A hyperscaler (or other &quot;embedded&quot; environment) might be willing or able
&gt; &gt; to go fix up userspace breakage. I would suspect our high frequency
&gt; &gt; trading friends would be all over this if it shaved a microsecond off
&gt; &gt; their receive times.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The more important question is what it breaks and how badly it breaks
&gt; &gt; things. 5-level paging, for instance, broke some JITs that historically
&gt; &gt; used the new (&gt;48) upper virtual address bits for metadata. The gains
&gt; &gt; from 5-level paging were big enough and the userspace breakage was
&gt; &gt; confined and fixable enough that 5-level paging was viable.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m not sure which side a larger base page side will fall on, though. Is
&gt; &gt; it going to be an out-of-tree hack that a few folks use, or will it be
&gt; &gt; more like 5-level paging and be good enough that it goes into mainline?
&gt; 
&gt; Just thinking about VMAs spanning partial pages makes me shiver. Or A
&gt; single page spanning multiple VMAs.

THP can span multiple VMAs. And can be partially mapped.

The only new thing is that we allow this for order-0 page now. And you
cannot realistically recover wasted memory -- no deferred split.

&gt; I haven&#x27;t seen the code yet, but I am certain that I will not like it.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m happy to be proven wrong :)

I will do my best, but no promises :)

If the cpu supports TLB coalescing there could easily be a net gain
using 64k pages for most of a program binary.
