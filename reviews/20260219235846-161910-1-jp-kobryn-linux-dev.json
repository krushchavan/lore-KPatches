This allows for easier identification of nodes under pressure due to NUMA imbalance scenarios. The counters are now displayed in /proc/zoneinfo's per-node section, while still being aggregated across all nodes in /proc/vmstat. Memcg accounting is preserved, and the virtio_balloon driver has been updated to use global_node_page_state() to fetch the counters."
