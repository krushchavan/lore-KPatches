It moves existing\nstatistic from global to per-net-namespace.\n\n---\n\nYes, netlink is a much cleaner interface but it requires userland\nutility written to retrieve and display the data in a user-friendly\nformat for end users or administrators. I think the output of\nat /proc/net/rpc/nfsd' is still useful for developers who want a\nquick look of what's going in the back channel.\n\n---\n\nI will look into this.\n\nThanks,\n-Dai",
