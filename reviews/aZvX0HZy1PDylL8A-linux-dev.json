Thank you\nfor the suggestion.\n\nI agree that using BPF would provide greater flexibility, allowing control not\njust at the memcg level, but also per-process or for complex workloads.\n(As like orchestrator and node controller)\n\nHowever, I am concerned that this level of freedom might introduce logical\ncontradictions, particularly regarding cgroup hierarchy semantics.\n\nFor example, BPF might allow a topology that violates hierarchical constraints\n(a concern that was also touched upon during LPC)\n\n  - Group A (Parent): Assigned to SSD1\n  - Group B (Child of A): Assigned to SSD2\n\nIf Group A has a `memory.swap.max` limit, and Group B swaps out to SSD2, it\ncreates a consistency issue. Group B consumes Group A's swap quota, but it is\nutilizing a device (SSD2) that is distinct from the Parent's assignment. This\ncould lead to situations where the Parent's limit is exhausted by usage on a\ndevice it effectively doesn't \"own\" or shouldn't be using.\n\nOne might suggest restricting BPF to strictly adhere to these hierarchical\nconstraints. However, doing so would effectively eliminate the primary\nadvantage of using BPF\\u2014its flexibility. If we are to enforce standard cgroup\nsemantics anyway, a native interface seems more appropriate than a constrained\nBPF hook.\n\nBeyond this specific example, I suspect that delegating this logic to BPF\nmight introduce other unforeseen edge cases regarding hierarchy enforcement.\nIn my view, the BPF approach seems more like a \"next step.\"\n\nSince you acknowledged that the idea of assigning swap devices to cgroups\n\"makes sense,\" I believe implementing this within the standard, strictly\nconstrained \"cgroup land\" is preferable. \n\nA strict cgroup interface ensures\nthat hierarchy and accounting rules are consistently enforced, avoiding the\npotential conflicts that the unrestricted freedom of BPF might create.\n\nUltimately, I hope this swap tier mechanism can serve as a foundation to be\nleveraged by other subsystems, such as BPF and DAMON.

What's the reason to use 'tiers' in the name? Is it similar to memory tiers\n   and you want promotion/demotion among the tiers?\n\n3. If a workload has multiple swap devices assigned, can you describe the\n   scenario where such workloads need to partition/divide given devices to their\n   sub-workloads?\n\nLet's start with these questions. Please note that I want us to not just look at\nthe current use-case but brainstorm more future use-cases and then come up with\nthe solution which is more future proof.\n\nthanks,\nShakeel",

He might have mistaken that the\ndiscussion concluded.\nConsider it is one of the iterations. It is hard enough to contribute\nto the kernel. Relax.\nPlus, much of the discussion on the mailing list always has differing\nopinions. So, it's hard to determine what is truly concluded.\nDifferent people might have different interitations of the same text.\n\n---\n\nIs that your biggest concern? Many different ways exist to solve that\nproblem. e.g. We can put a config option protecting it and mark it as\nexperimental. This will unblock the development allow experiment. We\ncan have more people to try it out and give feedback.\n\n---\n\nYes, my company uses a different swap device at different cgroup\nlevel. I did ask my coworker to confirm that usage. Control at the non\nroot level is a real need.\n\n---\n\nI think this swap device control is a very basic need. All your\nobjections to swapping control in the group can equally apply to\nzswap.writeback. Unlike zswap.writeback, which only control from the\nzswap behavior. This is a more generic version control swap device\nother than zswap as well. BTW, I raised that concern about\nzswap.writeback was not generic enough as swap control was limited\nwhen zswap was proposed. We did hold back zswap.writeback. The\nconsensers is interface can be improved as later iterations. So here\nwe are.\n\n---\n\nThere is a very long thread on the linux-mm maillist. I'm too lazy to dig it up.\n\nI can share our usage requirement to refresh your memory. We\ninternally use a cgroup swapfile control interface that has not been\nupstreamed. With this we can remove the need of that internal\ninterface and go upstream instead.\n\n---\n\nIt depends on the number of devices in the tiers. Different tiers\nmaintain an order. Within the same tier round robin.\n\n---\n\nI propose the tier name. Guilty. Yes, in was inpired by memory tiers.\nIt just different class of swap speeds. I am not fixed on the name. We\ncan also call it swap.device_speed_classes. You can suggest\nalternatives.\n\nPromotion / demotion is possible in the future. The current state,\nwithout promotion or demotion, already provides value. Our current\ndeployment uses only one class of swap device at a time. However I do\nknow other companies use  more than one class of swap device.\n\n---\n\nIn our deployment, we always use more than one swap device to reduce\nswap device lock contention.\nThe job config can describe the swap speed it can tolerate. Some jobs\ncan tolerate slower speeds, while others cannot.\n\n---\n\nTake zswap.writeback as example. We have a solution that worked for\nthe requirement at that time. Incremental improvement is fine as well.\nUsually, incremental progress is better. At least currently there is a\nreal need to allow different cgroups to select different swap speeds.\nThere is a risk in being too future-proof: we might design things that\npeople in the future don't use as we envisioned. I see that happen too\noften as well.\n\nSo starting from the current need is a solid starting point. It's just\na different design philosophy. Each to their own.\n\nThat is the only usage case I know. YoungJun feel free to add yours\nusage as well.\n\nChris",

          "raw_body": "Understood. Let's continue the discussion. :D\n\nChris has already provided a thorough response, but I would like to\nadd my perspective as well.\n\n---\n\nI understand your concern about committing to a stable interface too\nearly. As Chris suggested, we could reduce this concern by guarding\nthe interface behind a build-time config option or marking it as\nexperimental, which I will also touch on further below.\n\nOn that note, if BPF were to become the primary control mechanism,\nI am not sure a memcg interface would still be needed at all, since\nBPF already provides a high degree of freedom. However, that level\nof freedom is also what concerns me -- BPF-driven swap device\nassignments could subtly conflict with memcg hierarchy semantics in\nways that are hard to predict or debug. A more constrained memcg-based\napproach might actually be safer in that regard.\n\n---\n\nI think this concern is closely tied to your question #3 below about\nconcrete use cases for partitioning devices across sub-workloads.\nI hope my answer there helps clarify this.\n\n---\n\nAs I mentioned above, I think guarding the feature behind a build-time\nconfig or runtime constraints could keep the usage well-defined and\npredictable, while still being useful.\n\n---\n\nOur use case is simple at now. \nWe have two swap devices with different performance\ncharacteristics and want to assign different swap devices to different\nworkloads (cgroups).\n\nFor some background, when I initially proposed this, I suggested allowing\nper-cgroup swap device priorities so that it could also accommodate the\nbroader scenarios you mentioned. However, since even our own use case\ndoes not require reversing swap priorities within a cgroup, we pivoted\nto the \"swap tier\" mechanism that Chris proposed.\n\n---\n\nBoth. If devices are in the same tier with the same priority, round robin.\nIf they are in the same tier with different priorities, or in different\ntiers, ordering applies. The current tier structure should be able to\nsatisfy either preference.\n\n---\n\nThis was originally Chris's idea. I think he explained the rationale\nwell in his reply.\n\n---\n\nOne possible scenario is reducing lock contention by partitioning swap\ndevices between parent and child cgroups.\n\n---\n\nWe have clear production use cases from both us and Chris, and I also\npresented a deployment example in the cover letter.\n\nI think it is hard to design concretely for future use cases at this\npoint. When those needs become clearer, BPF with its flexibility\nwould be a better fit then. I see BPF as a natural extension path\nrather than a starting point.\n\nFor now, guarding the memcg & tier behind a CONFIG option would\nlet us move forward without committing to a stable interface, and\nwe can always pivot to BPF later if needed\n\nThanks,\nYoungJun Park",

From a\n  trade-off perspective, does it make sense to enable BPF\n  just for swap device control?\n\n- You suggest starting with BPF and discussing a stable\n  interface later. I am genuinely curious, are there actual\n  precedents where a BPF prototype graduated into a stable\n  kernel interface? \n\n- You raised that stable interfaces are hard to remove. Would\n  gating it behind a CONFIG option or marking it experimental\n  be an acceptable compromise?\n\n- You already acknowledged the use-case for assigning\n  different swap devices to different workloads. Your\n  objection is specifically about hierarchical parent-child\n  partitioning. If the interface enforced uniform policy\n  within a subtree, would that be acceptable?\n\n- We already run a modified kernel with internal swap control\n  in production and have real feedback from it. Requiring BPF\n  as a prerequisite to gather production experience seems\n  unnecessary when we are already doing that.\n\nTo be honest, I am having trouble understanding the motivation\nbehind the BPF-first validation approach.
