That seems\nlike a worthy endeavor and some of the union/#define tricks look like a\nlikely viable way to do it incrementally.\n\nBut I don't think there's going to be a lot of memory savings in the\nend. Maybe this would bring the mem= hyperscalers back into the fold and\nhave them actually start using 'struct page' again for their VM memory.\nDunno.\n\nBut, let's look at my kernel directory and round the file sizes up to\n4k, 16k and 64k:\n\nfind .  -printf '%s\\n' | while read size; do echo\t\\\n\t\t$(((size + 0x0fff) & 0xfffff000))\t\\\n\t\t$(((size + 0x3fff) & 0xffffc000))\t\\\n\t\t$(((size + 0xffff) & 0xffff0000));\ndone\n\n... and add them all up:\n\n11,297,648 KB - on disk\n11,297,712 KB - in a 4k page cache\n12,223,488 KB - in a 16k page cache\n16,623,296 KB - in a 64k page cache\n\nSo a 64k page cache eats ~5GB of extra memory for a kernel tree (well,\n_my_ kernel tree). In other words, if you are looking for memory savings\non my laptop, you'll need ~300GB of RAM before 'struct page' overhead\noverwhelms the page cache bloat from a single kernel tree.\n\nThe whole kernel obviously isn't in the page cache all at the same time.\nThe page cache across the system is also obviously different than a\nkernel tree, but you get the point.\n\nThat's not to diminish how useful something like this might be,\nespecially for folks that are sensitive to 'struct page' overhead or\nallocator performance.\n\nBut, it will mostly be getting better performance at the _cost_ of\nconsuming more RAM, not saving RAM.",
