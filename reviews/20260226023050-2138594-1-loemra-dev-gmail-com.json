Then it \nmakes a lot of sense.\n\nThere might be some ebs that were inhibited due to tree rebalancing or \ntree walking and are no longer used, but I don't think this is a blocker \nfor this patch.\n\nLooking forward to your next patch version :)",

      "patch_summary": "This patch addresses a potential issue in the Btrfs file system where COW (Copy On Write) amplification could occur due to incorrect handling of extent buffer writeback. The problem arises when multiple transactions modify the same extent buffer, and one transaction inhibits writeback after COWing the buffer, while another transaction reuses the buffer without re-COWing it. To fix this, the patch modifies the code to inhibit writeback not only when a buffer is COWed but also whenever a handle reuses a COWed buffer without re-COWing it."
