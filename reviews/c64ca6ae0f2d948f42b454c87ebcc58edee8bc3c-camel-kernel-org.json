      "patch_summary": "This patch fixes a build failure issue caused by a function being defined in multiple places, which is not allowed in C. The problem arises from the fact that the NFSD code has been modified to sign filehandles, but this change introduced duplicate definitions of a function. The approach taken was to remove the redundant definition and ensure that the function is only declared once."
