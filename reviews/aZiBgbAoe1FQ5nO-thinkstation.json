My head hurts thinking about whether that could work, \nmaybe it could (no idea about guard pages in there, though).\n\n\nLet's take a look at the history of page size usage on Arm (people can \nfeel free to correct me):\n\n(1) Most distros were using 64k on Arm.\n\n(2) People realized that 64k was suboptimal many use cases (memory\n     waste for stacks, pagecache, etc) and started to switch to 4k. I\n     remember that mostly HPC-centric users sticked to 64k, but there was\n     also demand from others to be able to stay on 64k.\n\n(3) Arm improved performance on a 4k kernel by adding cont-pte support,\n     trying to get closer to 64k native performance.\n\n(4) Achieving 64k native performance is hard, which is why per-process\n     page sizes are being explored to get the best out of both worlds\n     (use 64k page size only where it really matters for performance).\n\nArm clearly has the added benefit of actually benefiting from hardware \nsupport for 64k.\n\nIIUC, what you are proposing feels a bit like traveling back in time \nwhen it comes to the memory waste problem that Arm users encountered.\n\nWhere do you see the big difference to 64k on Arm in your proposal? \nWould you currently also be running 64k Arm in production and the memory \nwaste etc is acceptable?\n\n-- \nCheers,\n\nDavid",

Maybe this would bring the mem= hyperscalers back into the fold and\nhave them actually start using 'struct page' again for their VM memory.\nDunno.\n\nBut, let's look at my kernel directory and round the file sizes up to\n4k, 16k and 64k:\n\nfind .  -printf '%s\\n' | while read size; do echo\t\\\n\t\t$(((size + 0x0fff) & 0xfffff000))\t\\\n\t\t$(((size + 0x3fff) & 0xffffc000))\t\\\n\t\t$(((size + 0xffff) & 0xffff0000));\ndone\n\n... and add them all up:\n\n11,297,648 KB - on disk\n11,297,712 KB - in a 4k page cache\n12,223,488 KB - in a 16k page cache\n16,623,296 KB - in a 64k page cache\n\nSo a 64k page cache eats ~5GB of extra memory for a kernel tree (well,\n_my_ kernel tree). In other words, if you are looking for memory savings\non my laptop, you'll need ~300GB of RAM before 'struct page' overhead\noverwhelms the page cache bloat from a single kernel tree.\n\nThe whole kernel obviously isn't in the page cache all at the same time.\nThe page cache across the system is also obviously different than a\nkernel tree, but you get the point.\n\nThat's not to diminish how useful something like this might be,\nespecially for folks that are sensitive to 'struct page' overhead or\nallocator performance.\n\nBut, it will mostly be getting better performance at the _cost_ of\nconsuming more RAM, not saving RAM.",
